# MemAppender Project

This is a program which implements a memory-based appender for Log4j2 (as stated in the assignment sheet),
which captures log events up to a configurable maximum size.
When the maximum size is reached, the oldest log events are discarded.
This project also includes unit tests which will verify the functionality of the appender.
